# 4 Alpha: EmptyBin

**4 Alpha: EmptyBin**  is a solution aimed at providing a smart waste management system to help automate the process of identifying and managing waste levels in bins. By integrating technology and smart sensors, this project offers a more efficient way of managing waste disposal, ensuring timely waste collection, and minimizing environmental impact. This project was developed as part of the **Make-A-Ton 6.0** Hackathon held at CUSAT.





## Features

- **Smart Bin System**: The system uses sensors to detect the level of waste in bins and sends notifications when they are full, ensuring timely collection.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Waste levels can be monitored in real-time through a web or mobile app interface.
- **Data Analytics**: Provides insights into waste collection patterns, helping optimize waste collection routes and schedules.
- **Low Cost and Easy Setup**: Designed to be affordable and easy to install in both residential and commercial settings.
- **Sustainability**: Encourages eco-friendly waste disposal and recycling by preventing overfilled bins.



## Technologies Used

- **Arduino**: Microcontroller platform for sensor integration.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Used to measure the fill level of the bin.
- **IoT (Internet of Things)**: For sending real-time data to cloud-based services.
- **Firebase**: Used for real-time data storage and updates.
- **React**: Frontend web application for monitoring bin status.
- **Node.js**: Backend server for processing data and managing communication between sensors and user interfaces.



## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emptybin.git
   cd emptybin
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Frontend: Navigate to the frontend directory and install the necessary packages.
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```
   - Backend: Navigate to the backend directory and install the necessary packages.
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set Up Firebase**:
   - Create a Firebase project and configure Firebase in the backend.
   - Add the Firebase credentials to the backend configuration files.

4. **Upload Arduino Code**:
   - Load the Arduino code to the microcontroller to handle sensor readings and send data to the backend.

5. **Start the Development Server**:
   - Start the frontend:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm start
     ```
   - Start the backend:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     node server.js
     ```

6. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to start interacting with the smart bin system.

```



## How It Works

1. **Sensor Integration**: Ultrasonic sensors placed in bins measure the distance from the sensor to the waste inside, determining the fill level.
2. **Real-Time Data**: The microcontroller sends the fill data to the backend server, which processes and stores it in Firebase.
3. **User Interface**: The frontend application fetches real-time data from Firebase and displays the current status of each bin.
4. **Notifications**: When a bin reaches a certain threshold, notifications are sent to users or waste collection services.

## Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning**: Implement machine learning algorithms to predict waste patterns based on historical data.
- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile app for easier access and notifications.
- **Optimized Collection Routes**: Use the collected data to optimize waste collection routes and schedules, reducing costs and environmental impact.
